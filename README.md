# dodgeball-game

This is a simple dodgeball game created for a personal project. I have created all the pixel art assets for the game, but I do not own the music. The music is from Chrono Trigger composed by Yasonori Mitsuda entiled "Delightful Spekkio."

I built this game off a tutorial on YouTube by lowlevel86. You can find it at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EV3wxtoqJ4
